# Sample Perl Module

To build, give the following commands at the shell.

```sh
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
```

Optionally, if you wish to install the module.

```sh
make install
```

The `make` command is probably `nmake` under a Windows system. You may need to become root (or administrator) before doing the `make install` step.
